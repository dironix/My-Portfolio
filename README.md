Hi, I’m Diya Sarkar a passionate Full Stack Web Developer and innovator who loves blending technology with real-world impact.
With expertise in Node.js, React, MongoDB, Python, Java, and C, I enjoy building user-friendly, scalable, and sustainable solutions.

I’ve worked on projects ranging from:

🌍 VillageStay – a rural tourism and community-based marketplace

🏡 GaoSathii – promoting authentic rural tourism experiences

🛒 ShilpoKotha – an e-commerce platform for rural businesses

🤖 Marine ClearBot – an AI-powered solution for water pollution

🎮 Interactive apps like Tic-Tac-Toe, Weather App, and Stopwatch

💡 My mission is simple: to innovate the future by creating technology that empowers people, communities, and the planet.

Outside of tech, I enjoy cooking, painting, and travelling — exploring creativity, culture, and new experiences beyond the digital world.
